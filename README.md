 ## Description
Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.


 ## Apps Used
- Express.js will be used
- MongoDB will be used
- Javascript
- Both GET, PUT, DELETE and POST routes were used for retrieving data,



 ## Visuals
